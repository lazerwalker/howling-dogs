# Building Your Game For iOS And Submitting It

Setting up Twine App Builder for iOS has a whole bunch of setup steps, but you only need to do them once, and then everything will be simple and automatic. I believe in you!

## App Store Developer Account

As a warning: this process requires you to have a paid Apple Developer Account (approximately $100 USD/year, depending on your region). Apple has a few ways you can build apps locally without a paid membership, but that's limited in scope and won't help you if your goal is to distribute iOS apps rather than just install them onto your personal phone.

If you're someone who goes by a name that is not your "legal" name: do note that Apple is really nasty about this. An Apple developer account set up as a personal account must use your legal name. While in many countries it is very easy to set up a small company (e.g. a LLC in the US), Apple requires something called a "D&B number" to set up a corporate account. A D&B number often requires significant more work to acquire than simply setting up a corporate entity. I wish none of this was the case!
